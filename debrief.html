<li>

<p>
What kind of study is it, e.g., descriptive, correlational?
</p>

<p>
Experimental
</p>

<li>

<p>
What are the independent variables? How are you operationalizing them?
</p>

<p>
The independent variables are the availability of alternative causes you were presented with. You were randomly allocated into one of two groups: a hidden alternative or no alternative. 
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What are the dependent variables that were measured? How are you operationalizing them?
</p>

<p>
The dependent variable was your belief that the target cue caused the shock, operationalised by your responses to causal rating questions at the end of the experiment. 
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What is one potential confounding variable and how have you attempted to control for it?
</p>

<p>
A potential confounding variable is that participants had pre-existing biases about cues and their outcomes (e.g. the colour red may be associated with danger). We tried to control for this by setting up a cover story and instructing you to only use information from within the experiment to make your causal judgments. 
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What is one potential ethical issue, and how has the experimenter attempted to resolve it?
</p>

<p>
Participants might believe that the experiment is a test of their intelligence. We have attempted to resolve this by emphasising that there are no correct answers and we are only interested in what and how participants learn.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
How did the experimenter get from first year psychology to conducting this research?
</p>

<p>
I did my undergraduate in Finance and Psychology, going on to complete my honours in Psychology at UNSW. I have gone on to do a PhD which this research is for.
